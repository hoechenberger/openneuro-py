# Python

## Project management

- Dependencies are managed through `uv`.
- Always run the Python interpreter and Python tools via `uv run …`.

## Coding style

- Run `ruff` for linting and formatting code. Use the `ruff` VS Code extension and language server if available.
- Run `ty` for type checking. Use the `ty` VS Code extension and language server if available.
- Always run `ruff` and `ty` and fix surfacing errors and warnings before returning code to the user.
